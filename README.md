Basic Blockchain Implementation Project

This project is a simple blockchain prototype, aimed at demonstrating the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, including blocks, hashing, Proof of Work (PoW), and mining.

üìã Features

Block Structure Each block has the following elements:

Index: Its position in the blockchain.
Timestamp: The creation time of the block.
Data: Information such as transaction details or custom data.
Previous Hash: A reference to the previous block‚Äôs hash.
Hash: A unique identifier for the block.
Nonce: A value used in the Proof of Work process.
Genesis Block This is the first block in the chain and is used to initialize the blockchain.

Proof of Work (PoW) Implements a computational challenge that strengthens the security of the blockchain. Blocks are only added once a cryptographic puzzle is solved.

Mining New Blocks New blocks are added to the blockchain by solving the Proof of Work puzzle, ensuring security and integrity.

Blockchain Validation Ensures the blockchain‚Äôs validity by verifying:

Hash integrity.
The correct linkage between consecutive blocks.
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Blocks Every block stores data and contains a reference to the previous block‚Äôs hash.

Proof of Work Mining involves solving a hash puzzle that meets a set difficulty level (e.g., starting with specific characters like "0000").

Validation The blockchain is validated by checking:

That each block‚Äôs hash is consistent with its data.
The hash of the current block matches the hash referenced by the previous block.
üöÄ Getting Started

Set Up the Development Environment Install a Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Compile and Execute Run the program to initialize and create your blockchain.

Experiment Add new blocks and mine them to see the blockchain in action.

üîß Example Code

java

// Create the genesis block
Block genesisBlock = createGenesisBlock();
addBlock(genesisBlock);

// Mine and add a new block
Block newBlock = new Block(1, "Transaction: Alice sends Bob 10 BTC", genesisBlock.hash);
newBlock.mineBlock(4); // Difficulty: 4 leading zeros
addBlock(newBlock);

// Validate the blockchain
System.out.println("Is the blockchain valid? " + isChainValid());
üìä Sample Output

mathematica

Genesis Block created with hash: 0000abcd1234...
Mining block 1...
Block mined! Hash: 0000efgh5678...
Is the blockchain valid? true
üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Feel free to:

Modify block data to add custom fields.
Adjust the mining difficulty.
Add new features, such as transactions, wallets, or a consensus algorithm.
